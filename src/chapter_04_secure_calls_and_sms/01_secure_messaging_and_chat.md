Secure Messaging
================

SMS are short messages sent between mobile phones. The text is sent without encryption and can be read and stored by mobile phone providers and other parties with access to the network infrastructure to which you're connected. To protect your messages from interception you need to use end-to-end encryption on your text messages.

Android  - Installing Signal
---------------------------

To encrypt messages sent to others, you can use Signal for Android. (Previously it was named TextSecure). It provides end-to-end encryption with support for group messaging, emojis, and even support for unencrypted messaging. Supporting both SMS and MMS messaging, Signal is a drop in replacement for your stock messaging application on Android. Signal can also stores all of your messages in an encrypted database. Furthermore, Signal will transparently use end-to-end encryption for any other Signal user, without need to share keys before hand (although you should verify public keys as much as possible). Again, Signal requires the use of the Google Play framework. 

iOS - Signal
---------------------------


To encrypt sages sent to others, you can use Signal for iOS devices that use iOS 8 and higher as the operating system. Signal provides end-to-end encryption with an easy to use interface (it was designed to resemble iMessage). Unlike Androdi, Signal does not stores your messages in seperate encrypted database, although your iPhone should use full disk encryption by default. Furthermore, Signal will transparently use end-to-end encryption for any other Signal user, without need to share keys before hand (although you should verify public keys as much as possible).
